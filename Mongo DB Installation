This guide is based on my experience of installign and running MongoDB on Windows 7 Enterprise Edition - 64 bit  Operating System.

Steps:-

1. Download Community Edition of Mongodb from the following link or google.
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/

2. Install the using default settings.

3. Create the fodler structure on your machine c:\data\db
* Not sure, what to do if you don's have a c drive. I guess, if your installation directory is D:\ProgramFiles\Mongo then you need to 
create the folder structure  D:\data\db

4.Go to the bin folder of mongodb installation and run the following command:-
> mongod.exe --storageEngine=mmapv1

The server should start.

5. Now we want to use the server. open another cmd prompt and navigate to the bin folder. and run
the command:-
> mongo

This should start a mongo console where you can use a varierty of commands to use the database.

==================MongoDB installation is complete. Your Mongo instance is running====================
Before you proceed, understand the architechture of data storage in MongoDB.
1. Mongo has multiple databases.
2.  Each database can have multiple collections. A collection is equivalent to a RDBMS table.
3. Each collection can have data stored in dofferent formats, most commonly as objects.
Example insert code:-
db.users.insert({x:1,y:2});


==================Now, you can use the belowgiven set of basic commands to play around==================

> show dbs// shows all the databases.

> use customerapp ///to create a new database and switch to it

> db.createCollection('users')//create a new collection
//Collection - A grouping of MongoDB documents. A collection is the equivalent of an RDBMS table.
//A collection exists within a single database. Collections do not enforce a schema.

> show collections //displays all the collections in a database.

> db.users.insert([{fullname:"Ashish Mishra",email:"as.mishra@gmail.com"},{fullname:"Pramd
Pandey",email:"pramod.pandey@gmail.com"}])
//THis was to insert entries in the mongodb database.

> db.users.find()//displays all the entries


==============================================================================================================================


Importing a json file in MongoDB using mongo import command:-

> mongoimport --db custdb --collection users < MOCK_DATA.json

Note: Your json data should be in the format:-

{
"mydata": 
    [
    {
          "project": "project_1",
          ...
          "priority": 7
    }
    ]
}



Note:  
Perhaps the following reference from the MongoDB project blog could help you gain insight on how arrays work in Mongo:
