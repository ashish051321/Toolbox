> git init

//suppose in your project directory, there is another folder called "node_modules" and you dont want git to add commit and track this folder, then you must create a 

.gitignore file and put the following line inside that file:-

/node_modules


//Setting the user.name and user.email in git
> git config user.name ashish051321

> git config user.email ashish.25jl@gmail.com

//Now you start workign on your project and create a bunch of files. 
// Now you want to commit the changes to the master branch.
// THe master branch is the default branch.


> git add .
> git commit -a -m "Changes cmoitted to the repository for the first time"


//To check  the curent status of git file tracking
> git status



// To create a new branch
> git branch newBranch1



//Switching to the new branch
> git checkout newBranch1



//Creating and checking out to a new branch in one go:-
> git checkout -b <new_branch>


// Listing all the branches in your repository
> git branch -a



// Adding remotes to git- The entire concept:-
/*

To see which remote servers you have configured, you can run the git remote command. It lists the shortnames of each remote 
handle you’ve specified. If you’ve cloned  your repository, you should at least see origin — that is the
default name Git gives to the server you cloned from.


To see the url of the all the remotes you have:-
> git remote -v


To get all the branches of your git repository:-
> git init
> git remote add origin <<URL>>
> git fetch --all
// This fetches all the banches for this repository.
// Now, you can go to the branch of your choosing, by checking out into it, like this:-

> git checkout <<branch_name>>


Question: Now, suppose, I am clonign a github repo which has got multiple branches. WIll all the branches as well get cloned or only the master branch ?
> git clone https://github.com/ashish051321/rxjs-project.git
Answer: Yes, all the branches will also get cloned. You can switch to those branches with git checkout command.


================Adding a new remote================
The git remote add command takes two arguments:

A remote name, for example, origin
A remote URL, for example, https://github.com/user/repo.git

> git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git

================================================================================

Question: What is git remote add ...
Answer: As you probably know, git is a distributed version control system. Most operations are done locally. 
To communicate with the outside world, git uses what are called remotes. These are repositories other than 
the one on your local disk which you can push your changes into (so that other people can see them) or pull from (so that 
you can get others changes). The command git remote add origin git@github.com:peter/first_app.gitcreates a new remote 
called origin located at git@github.com:peter/first_app.git. Once you do this, in your push commands, you can push 
to origin instead of typing out the whole URL.

//See all the remotes that you  have configured so far:-
> git remote -v

================Pushing to a remote================

> git push  <REMOTENAME> <BRANCHNAME> 

> git push origin master

//getting code from a github repository. Very simple. Just do a git clone.
> git clone <rep_url>
Example:-
> git clone https://github.com/ashish051321/rxjs-project.git

This command will get you all code including the branches from the remote repository.
Now, you can switch to a branch and do the changes:-
> git checkout loadingMovies

Adn then you can simply git push the branch to the origin and the remote repository's corresponding branch will get updated.

> git push origin loadingMovies

-----Now, another scenario where you want to create a new branch on your local machine and update the remote repository as well.
> git checkout -b trialBranch

Now make some changes. 

> git checkout -a -m "changes done"

Now, you can simply git push the new branch to the origin and a new branch will automaticaly get created on your remote repository.

> git push origin trialBranch
